# TODO

1. Add a table users to the diagram, it is the one from supabase

# Users Page

## Addding a new person:

- Due to the error with supabase and user UID, for now the user creation is not functioning properly
- It does work with pre-determined list of personel in each organization
- It will require updates in the database, as this error is due to the fact that i am using supabase and its verification
- Therefore, for now the adding new people functionality is not possible, it is only possible with creating the users manually

- The ability to work with user UID still exists wchich will be required in palces like chat, teams, tasks as it takes that value from users2 table

# GENERAL

Add a trasnsition before loading a page to make sure all the elements are loadded
